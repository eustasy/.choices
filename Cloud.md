## Domain Registrars

Domains may be registered in **Dedicated Registrars**, in which the registration and management of domains is their primary business, or **Service Registrars**, in which domains are supplementary to their main product(s). Dedicated Registrars can be used to centralise domain renewal when using multiple platforms with single or mutliple domains, whereas Service Registrars can offer tighter integration with their product offering, such as 1-click DNSSEC setup with Cloudflare.
